## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file to see changes sorted by version.
### Features:
- [ ] ~~Export to different file types? (PDF, Word, etc.)~~

- [ ] Reduce file title length and move the next as the subtitle
```md
# My title...
### ... is too long
```
- [x] Model name instead of "AI Answer" (e.g. "GPT-3.5 Answer", "Phind Answer")
- [x] Source numbers next to the source links (numbered list corresponding to citations)
- [x] Export question above sources
- [x] Code type (language) specified in codeblocks (üëç Thanks to @nhuhoang0701)
- [x] Include AI response quotes after the response
- [x] Export source links
- [x] Link to the Phind original search on the file top

### Bugs/Issues:

- [x] Special characters in title are not correctly formatted (e.g. "\n" should be "\\n")
- [x] Fix broken quotes links
- [x] Fix bug not exporting correctly (AI begins with backtick?, citations so the HTML structure is different?)
- [x] Icons instead of sources
- [x] Code is not correctly formatted when converting Html to md
- [x] Not longer exporting AI answers and source links
  => stronger CSS selectors (try not to use styling classes)

  => title taken from search bar
