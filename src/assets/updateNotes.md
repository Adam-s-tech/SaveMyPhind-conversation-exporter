# Update notes
# v1.9.8
тиа Filter your threads list!
You just want to retrieve that damn chat you started 5 days ago? No problem: start typing in the filter bar to find it quickly!

тиа File export improvements
Hoora! The file name now contains the tool used (New Phind or Basic search). In addition, some format bugs were solved...

тиа Some UI progress
Tried to improve the Phind global UI (hard but needed!). Plus, extension compenents are better integrated in the Phind interface. 


# v1.8.4
тиа Now inside the Phind interface!
You can now export a Phind thread using the button inside the page (but you always can click on the extension icon).

тиа Export all your threads in 1 click!
Just click on the "Export All Threads" button! It could be long, so you have time to drink your triple coffee dose ЁЯЩГ.

тиа Some bugs solved
File names, title bugs, these kind of things...


# Copilot proposals
the extension icon is now a bit more... "Phind"!
